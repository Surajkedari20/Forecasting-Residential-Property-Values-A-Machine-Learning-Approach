# Forecasting-Residential-Property-Values-A-Machine-Learning-Approach
This project aims to leverage historical property data along with various features such as location, property size, amenities, economic indicators, and market trends to train accurate models.
# Introduction:
This repository contains the code and resources for implementing a machine learning approach to forecast residential property values. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the value of residential properties based on various features such as location, size, amenities, and economic indicators.
# Dependencies:
The code is written in Python and requires the following libraries:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* XGBoost (optional, for advanced modeling)

# Installation:
To install the required dependencies, run the following command:
  pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn 

# Data Preprocessing:
*Load the dataset into a DataFrame.
*Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
*Perform feature engineering to extract relevant features and transform categorical variables.
*Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

#Model Training:
*Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for regression tasks, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.
*Train the models using the training data.
*Tune hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation or grid search to improve model performance.

# Model Evaluation:
*Evaluate the trained models using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
*Compare the performance of different models to select the best-performing one.

# Prediction:
*Use the trained model to make predictions on new data or unseen residential properties.
*Evaluate the predictions and assess the model's accuracy and reliability.

# Results:
*The results of the model evaluation and prediction can be visualized using plots and metrics to provide insights into the performance and reliability of the forecasting model.
